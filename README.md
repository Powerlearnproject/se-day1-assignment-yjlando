#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systeatic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process with fixed phases (like requirements, design, and testing), making it best for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, such as medical systems. Changes are hard to implement once a phase is complete, and collaboration is limited. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, with work divided into cycles (like sprints). It emphasizes continuous feedback, adaptability, and regular deliveries, making it ideal for dynamic projects like mobile apps, where requirements evolve. Waterfall suits predictable projects, while Agile excels in fast-changing environments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools that streamline and enhance the software development process. IDEs, like Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA, offer a complete toolkit for writing, debugging, and testing code in one place. They provide features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and built-in debuggers, which boost productivity and reduce errors. On the other hand, VCS tools like Git and Subversion help teams track code changes, collaborate, and manage different versions of a project. They allow developers to experiment with features in separate branches, roll back to previous versions if needed, and avoid conflicts when merging code. Together, IDEs and VCS create a smooth, efficient workflow — IDEs simplify coding, while VCS keeps everything organized and under control.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face several common challenges, but with the right strategies, these hurdles can be managed effectively. One major challenge is changing requirements, which can cause scope creep and project delays. To handle this, teams can adopt Agile methodologies, breaking work into smaller iterations and regularly reassessing goals to adapt to evolving needs. Tight deadlines are another issue, often leading to rushed development and compromised quality. Prioritizing tasks, focusing on high-impact features, and maintaining clear communication with stakeholders can help teams balance speed with quality. Technical debt — accumulated from quick fixes or suboptimal code — can slow future development and raise maintenance costs. To mitigate this, teams should schedule regular code reviews, allocate time for refactoring, and document trade-offs to avoid hidden pitfalls. Ultimately, fostering a culture of open communication, continuous improvement, and proactive problem-solving helps teams stay resilient and deliver better software, even in the face of challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of carefully crafting inputs to guide generative AI models toward producing desired, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs. It’s essential for enhancing user experience, as well-constructed prompts can yield relevant results right away and reduce biases inherited from training data. Prompt engineering also increases flexibility, allowing for domain-neutral instructions that reveal patterns and logical connections. Moreover, it gives developers more control over interactions, setting intent and context for more predictable, useful AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, including examples of how it improves diagnosis and patient care."

The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows the topic, sets a clear focus (AI in healthcare), and specifies what aspects to cover (impact, examples, diagnosis, and patient care). This clarity helps the AI provide a targeted, meaningful response rather than a broad, unfocused overview.
